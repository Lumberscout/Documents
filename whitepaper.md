---------------------------

**Summary of What We Are Developing**

Lumberscout will use decentralized technologies to radically change the forest products sector; providing a safe platform for industrial producers, industrial consumers and industrial lenders to conduct business. Lumberscout’s implementation of distributed ledgers, commodity certifications, supply chain verification and efficient sales architecture will fundamentally change how forest products are financed, traded and certified. By harnessing disruptive technologies and establishing verification and governance frameworks, Lumberscout makes trustless, meritocratic consensus mechanisms possible on a global scale. The first steps towards these ends started with the creation of the smartphone Lumberscout app. Integrations of the functionalities outlined in the white paper will be integrated into subsequent version releases.

**Market Size**

Forest Products account for 5% of Gross World Product or 4 trillion USD in 2016. To put that in perspective, if you spent one USD per second, it would take you approximately 126,836 years to reach 4 trillion. According to U.N. statistics 33% of the world population currently depends on Forest Products for sustenance. Despite the importance of Forest Products to the global economy, novelties like “ride-sharing” services or “crypto-kitties” have distracted many to the fact that recent technological breakthroughs can entirely revolutionise established commodity-based industries. Lumberscout will redefine the Forest Products sector.

**Disruption**

Disruptive technologies redefine markets. Blockchain distributed ledgers have multiple use cases that can disrupt the Forest Products sector. Cash-Against-Documents (CAD) transactions are just one standard industry practice that will be made obsolete by distributed ledgers. Buying, selling, financing, transportation, insurance and certification of Forest Products are other important areas for change. Instead of relying on local banks, borrowers have the possibility to obtain loans from the emergent crypto lending market and can finalise purchasing contracts in crypto-currencies. Lumberscout will be the catalyst that empowers users to conduct business using mobile handheld devices at any time, from anywhere in the world.

**Tokenization of Forest Products**

As the crypto-economy grows, so too does the demand for the tokenisation of commodities. The blockchain, much like containerised shipping, has redefined global trade. However, the practical aspects of verification at the beginning stages of the distributed ledger process requires close attention and new management infrastructures. Sending containers around the world is a logistic feat, but without verifying the contents, value cannot be established. Lumberscout will implement verify and track procedures throughout the harvesting, production, transportation and manufacturing stages. By reliably tokenizing commodities, Lumberscout will connect the crypto economy with the Market of Things (MoT).

**Increasing the Liquidity of the Forest Products Sector**

The Forest Products industry is typically cash strapped to the point that there is no extra capital to make needed investments in machinery, automation or sustainability. Especially productions in developing nations that want to modernize and become responsible producers, access to funds and basic safety equipment are sorely lacking. Small loans can mean the difference between crushing poverty and lives filled with stewardship and meaningful work. By facilitating reputation-based lending with decentralized credit ratings, consisting of data on trade performance and data feeds from service providers such as credit institutions and social media, Lumberscout will provide investors with the information they need. Moreover, services such as Bloom would be used to broadcast defaults to centralized credit scores.

**Empowering Crypto Lenders**

By providing secured assets with the use of DAK tokens as collateral to major crypto lenders like SALT, ETHlend, et al. — as well as private lenders — Lumberscout’s system of verification will be a pivotal actor in the tokenised collateral chain. Forest Products manufacturers that adopt Lumberscout’s verification program will gain access to heretofore impossible liquidity. For example, TALLY token holders can exchange them for commodity tokens on the platform, but are not required to do so. They can be held as collateral. Instead, the applicant can pledge his tokens to receive funds. In this way, commodity tokens can be used to secure loans and can be sold off if required.

**Increasing Sales Efficiency**

Lumberscout’s bidding, personal messaging system and social-media distributed inventory databases, funnel activity into formalised contracts with maximum efficiency. Bids can be made specifying quantities, grades, delivery and payment terms. At the end of the bidding process, both parties are sent copies of the contract and can download them from user account archives, where they are saved and timestamped. Each contract and their subsequent rating will form an irrevocable part of user reputation. These processes utilise technology to save time and reduce errors.

**Reducing Fraud**

In addition to Lumberscout’s own credit rating system, Lumberscout will, on behalf of the user — if so desired — allow their scores to be broadcast to other decentralized credit rating institutions. Additionally, oracles can be used to provide feeds from social media for creating a more complete credit profile. In this way Lumberscout will act as a third-party repository of unalterable data that will serve lenders, financial markets and trade partners in perpetuity. Adoption of Lumberscout’s rating system will become more valuable to sellers, buyers and lenders over time as its data grows and its predictive algorithms are refined.

**Institution of Certification Processes**

To insure conformity to Lumberscout guidelines and mandates, certification and auditing procedures will be implemented on multiple fronts. Self-audits will begin the certification process and verified by auditors specifically to establish grading accuracy, commodity volumes and other factors such as best forestry practices. Certification is a necessary prerequisite for secure decentralised participation in the MoT.

**Collateral Management (risk mitigation)**

Lumberscout will institute a collateral management system to limit loss in cases where collateral value drop below a certain threshold, the borrower must increase their collateral or the lender can call the collateral and sell it on the market. Alternatively, collateral swapping will be introduced where the lender can swap the collateral for a fee, to less volatile tokens, instead of selling.

**Simplified User Experience**

Lumberscout is developing a more user friendly experience for the app including social media integration, syncing of inventory systems and intuitive lending and supply chain interfaces. As Dieter Rams put it: “Good design is as little design as possible”. Lumberscout’s user experience must be second nature: useful, unobtrusive, thorough, honest, reliable.

**Competitive Bidding**

Lumberscout bidding functionality will be expanded from industrial commodities like logs, lumber and machinery to service providers: insurance, lending, freight forwarders and shipping. This will create competitive market conditions. For example, lenders can participate in interest rate bidding auctions; logistic companies can bid on freight routes and insurance companies can bid based on supplier risk profiles.

**Currency Exchange Risk Management (FIAT pegging) and Atomic Swaps**

Exchange risk exposure is potentially disruptive if a borrower borrows 1 ETH when the ETH price is at USD 15000, but then rises to 30000 or crashes back down to 1000. Such a situation can be solved by providing FIAT based loans where the loan amount is represented in FIAT currency, even though the transaction is conducted in BTC. FIAT pegging also creates wider opportunities for lending and commodity investment purposes.

**Artificial Intelligence, Big Data Market Analytics, Credit Risk Forcasting**

Lumberscout will be among the first to develop artificial intelligence (AI) protocols for assessing ledger data to predict credit risk. Such AI bots will harvest and filter data and calculate early warning signals according to established financial models to better aid lender decision-making. This will provide ample room to cooperate with Gnosis and Augur to develop better indicators of future events.

**Supply Chain Integration**

Lumberscout will be at the forefront of integrating blockchain based logistics into the Lumberscout platform. Earlier this year Maersk shipping (the world’s largest container shipping line), announced that it was cooperating with IBM to put all of its shipping on the blockchain within two years. Similar adoptions of blockchain technology will take place in domestic trucking operations. Lumberscout will be the app that aggregates these service providers and validation nodes into one application. This will increase transparency and security for buyers, sellers and lenders.

**Implementation of Block-Chain-of-Custody (BCoC) Sustainable Forestry Standards**

Unknown to many outside the Forest Product sector, there are a variety of companies offering forest certifications. The problem with these companies is that they have become for-profit bureaucracies that obliquely follow their mandate. Within the context of the Lumberscout DAO, holistic approaches to sustainability are possible. Once industry consensus is reached, such certifications can be put into practice.

**DAO Governance**

Parallel to developing better inventory visibility, sales and supply chain infrastructure, Lumberscout will implement a DAO based delegate system for global governance and the continuous evolution of industry standards and practices, such as: forestry certification, grading standardisation, collateral management and codification of international regulations. Proper DAO governance can solve problems before they devolve into costly disputes that end up in prolonged, centralised arbitration. The recent softwood trade dispute between USA and Canada is one recent example that can be expected to repeat itself unless better inter-trade regulations and decentralised consensus mechanisms are put into place. With DAO appointed regional delegates and transparent voting mechanisms the responsibilities of stewardship and consensus can organised regionally and globally. By building delegations, Lumberscout can impactfully improve sustainability and the global trading environment of Forest Products.

**Onboarding Insurance Providers**

Lumberscout will work together with insurance providers to streamline coverage with the help of programmed contracts and distributed ledger technology. The Forest Products sector relies considerably on insurance to underwrite risk. Lumberscout can provide the insurers the information they need to assess risk accurately. Lumberscout can provide insurers critical actuarial data needed to calculate appropriately in each use case. Using AI and Big Data for insuring credit risk. Lumberscout will provide a protocol for AI developers to use ledger transaction data to provide insurance carriers with actuarial inputs. The aim is to create a revenue stream for AI developers and to incentivise creating bots with greater predictive power. Competition in this area would lower insurance policy costs. Moreover, these bots could be used to assess credit risk and subsequently credit insurance for trades.

**Lending Based on Reputation**

A reputation system is a convenient way to establish trust between the buyers, sellers and lenders. By creating a data repository of identities, transactions and their subsequent cross-evaluation by the parties involved and making the satisfaction or dissatisfaction of the involved parties a matter of record, Lumberscout’s data will serve the community by establishing reputations based on past behaviour. By using reputation, Lumberscout will reduce the risks to buyers, sellers and lenders alike.

**Logistics Partnerships**

Lumberscout will develop auction-like bidding functionality to provide better freight rates. The lowest freight rate bid will win the auction and the programmed contract will accept that particular shipper as the funder of that programmed freight contract. Such bidding will provide the most competitive rate for the shippers since unlimited forwarders can participate on the bid. This can be applied to domestic trucking companies and scale up to include ocean shipping.

**Programmed Contracts**

Collateral enables secured trading and lending. The Lumberscout system allows collateral to be applied to conditional programmed contracts. If one of the parties does not perform their part according to the contract, funds can be returned. For example, a buyer applies pre-payment to a purchasing contract contingent on it shipping within two weeks. The seller has the surety that he will be paid, prompting him to act. The buyer’s risk of non-shipment is mitigated. If the conditions are not met he is refunded his deposit. The same principle can be applied between lenders and borrowers.

**Industry News**

Scattered, paper-based publications based on voluntary information typify the industry. Realtime hard data is hard to come by. Lumberscout will fundamentally change how the industry experiences news and market dynamics using smart algorithms. In addition to relevant trade news and featured articles, members will be encourage to participate with uncensored commentary. Commentators will also have the chance to be rewarded with TLY by the community for particularly astute or poignant observations. This will encourage participation and incentivise quality journalism.

**Know Your Customer (KYC)**

KYC regulation applies on money lending between borrowers and lenders. When FIAT is lent, the lender must conduct ‘known your customer’ compliance on certain thresholds by verifying the customer, the origins of the funds and other related verifications. The thresholds do vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction but remain similar in principle. However, uncertainty lies within lending tokens since tokens are not a currency by definition of governments. Therefore, whether lending tokens is subject to KYC is an unsettled question.

**Translations**

Languages included in the current 2.9.6 version of Lumberscout are: German, French, Polish, Russian, Chinese, Spanish, Japanese, Portuguese, Estonian, Ukrainian, Arabic and Hindi. Additional translations are planned.

**Governance**

Lumberscout will follow a decentralized governance model similar to DAO. It will provide a forum for all members as well as institute a delegate system. Propositions can be put to a vote. Decisions are binding. Regular changes would require a majority of voters present and core changes would require 2/3 of the voters present. The aim is to create a democratic system to control app development. Moreover, it is crucial that all members can participate, make suggestions and vote.

Towards this purpose a Swiss Foundation or Swiss LLC will be created that connects DAO governance to Lumberscout. Such connection might not be ideal when we are aiming for complete decentralization. However, such a layer is vital for protecting our users from unforeseeable regulatory hazards.

Roadmap to consensus. The final charter of the DAO and its immutable policies will be formalised within 3 years of the token sale. By this time, most essential business functions of the app will have made it through the rigorous testing period.

**Lack of a Global Trading Platform**

There is no global trading platform that provides the functionalities outlined in this white paper. Distributed ledgers can provide access to tokenised Forest Products. Blockchain technology makes it possible to send immutable transactions within the context of transparent contracts. By using distributed ledgers, decentralised participation in traditionally closed off markets is possible.

**Introducing the TALLY Token (TLY) and the Token Sale**

Tallies have been used by mankind for thousands of years. A 30,000 year old scrap of bone found in Czechoslovakia in 1937 by Karel Absolon, shows an early use case of a tally system. “Split tallies” were widely used in northern Europe up until the 19th century. Split tallies, often made from hazel wood, were distributed ledgers: neither party could change their half of the tally stick without the participation, knowledge or acceptance of the other party. This was accomplished by splitting a stick down the middle and then marking both halves with perfectly matching tally marks. If the two halves did not fit together precisely or the marks did not align, fraud could easily be established in a court of law. One downside to using tallies made of wood was flammability: They burnt down the Houses of Parliament in 1834. After due consideration, it has been decided to mint TLY as a modified ERC20 token for crowdsale. The aim of the token sale is to reward early adopters and further develop the application and management systems.

**Principles of the tokens sale**

Lumberscout aims for a token sale that is democratic, decentralized, secure and fair. This also applies to the vesting model and to the future governance of Lumberscout. In the spirit of democracy, anyone can buy TLY during the Token Sale period.

Utility function 1: Users that pay fees with TLY tokens on the Lumberscout platform would receive a 25% price discount compared to paying with ETH or non-native currencies.

Utility function 2: Featured services would only with payable with TLY tokens. Lumberscout will provide functions that are only possible with the use of TLY (can be only paid with TLY). These featured functions will include access to competitive logistics, lending, insurance and environmental certifications. This would require users to buy back tokens from the marketplace and generate perpetual demand for TLY.

Utility function 3: Loans and longterm supply contracts can be concluded using TLY as a token for settlements. Such practice would shield buyer and seller from unnecessary domestic FIAT risk and would also require both parties to have enough TLY to fulfil their obligations.

Utility function 4: All advertising on the mobile app, in the news feed or on the web app will be paid for in TLY. As a clearing house for information, Lumberscout will leverage its market position to profit from growing advertising revenues. With increasing transactions, the aggregated trade data will become valuable indicator of market direction.

Utility function 5: Commodity verification procedures used for increasing liquidity, buyer security or cash-against-documents transactions will accept TLY as a medium for payment.

Utility function 6: Forestry certification program: Manufacturers that pay for their certification with TLY will get a 50% discount.

**Token Sale**

The total supply of TLY is limited to 1 300 000 000 TLY. Of the total supply, 300 000 000 TLY will be sent to a development fund and locked for a period of two years. TLY unsold during initial crowdsales will be transferred to a holding account and held indefinitely or used in bonus crowdsale rounds if required.

Pre-sale starts on 15 February 2018. A maximum of 91 000 000 000 TLY (7% of total) will be offered for sale at 21 000 TLY per 1 ETH

Pre-sale ends on ends on 25 February 2018.

Preffered sale starts on 01 March 2018. A maximum of 91 000 000 000 TLY (7% of total) will be offered for sale at 15 500 TLY per 1 ETH

Preffered sale ends on 15 March 2018.

Main sale starts on 20 March 2018 and ends on 20 May 2018. 9 500 TLY will be offered per 1 ETH.

Purchase Price

Endorsing early purchase. We want to endorse token buyers that are among the first by rewarding them with bonus tokens.

Minimum amount to participate: 0.5 ETH.

**Token Distribution**

TLY is distributed immediately once ETH is sent to the crowdsale address. Participants are advised to send smaller amounts to verify whether they have received TLY. Instant distribution is fair because the participants do not need to wait for TLY. Once ETH is received, TLY is sent to the participant’s wallet address.

**Funds Allocation**

Most of the funds are allocated to further development of the app: either on core development or on user experience development. Lumberscout fund allocation is based on the following:

30% on core development
20% on user experience development
10% on management & legal
30% on promotions & marketing
10% on unexpected costs
Fund allocation is subject to change. Lumberscout will use best management practices and allocate funds at its own discretion.

**Token Sale Entity**
