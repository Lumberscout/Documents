**Summary of What We Are Developing**

Lumberscout will use decentralized technologies to change the forest products (FP) sector; providing a safe platform for industrial producers, industrial consumers and industrial lenders to conduct business. Lumberscout’s implementation of distributed ledgers, commodity certifications, supply chain verification and efficient sales architecture will fundamentally change how FPs are financed, traded and certified. By harnessing disruptive technologies and establishing verification and governance frameworks, Lumberscout makes trustless, meritocratic consensus mechanisms possible on a global scale. 



**Ethics & Standards**

Lumberscout is committed to ethical behavior and the advancement of industry by developing efficient, trustworthy trading infrastructure. Lumberscout is dedicated to the values of fairness, integrity, applicable law and human rights. Lumberscout will act to protect the confidentiality, privacy and wishes of our users, partners, and community. Lumberscout will engage in critical and regular assessments. Lumberscout will consistently and unwaveringly act in the best interests of our users, partners, investors, privacy, autonomy and the environment.




**Tokenization of FPs**

As the crypto-economy grows, so too does the demand for the tokenisation of commodities. Distributed ledgers, much like containerised shipping, will redefine global trade. Verification at the beginning stages of the distributed ledger process requires close attention and new management as well as legal precedents. Lumberscout will implement verify and track procedures throughout the harvesting, production, transportation and manufacturing stages. By taking the first steps towards tokenising commodities, Lumberscout will connect the crypto economy with the Market of Things (MoT).




**Commodity Focus**

By establishing LUMBER as a benchmark of utility within the context of Lumberscout's trading platform, its convertibility will become more recognised as a standardised store of value for a new class of economic operators in a growing crypto economy. 



**Market Size**

FPs account for 5% of Gross World Product or 4 trillion USD in 2016. To put that number in perspective, if you spent one USD per second, it would take approximately 126,836 years to reach 4 trillion. According to U.N. statistics, 33% in the world population depends on FPs for basic sustenance. Despite the importance of FPs to the global economy, novelties continue to dominate the headlines. The fact remains: practical implementations of distributed ledgers will revolutionise commodity-based industries. Lumberscout will redefine the FPs sector.





**Empowering Crypto Lenders**

By providing LUMBER as collateral to major crypto lenders like ETHlend, SALT, et al. — as well as private lenders — Lumberscout’s system of verification will be a pivotal actor in the tokenised collateral chain. FP manufacturers that adopt Lumberscout’s verification program can choose to exchange product for LUMBER of equivalent value. In this way, LUMBER can be used to secure loans or speed up the sales and payment processes within the platform. In addition to Lumberscout’s own credit rating system, Lumberscout will, on behalf of the user — if so desired — allow their scores to be broadcast to other decentralised credit rating institutions. In this way Lumberscout can act as a third-party for lenders, financial markets and trade partners. Adoption of Lumberscout’s rating system will become more valuable to sellers, buyers and lenders over time.



**Environmental and Value Certification Processes**

To insure Lumberscout's environmental commitment as well as value assessment  certification, auditing procedures will be implemented on multiple fronts. Self-audits will begin the process with special attention given to grading accuracy, commodity volumes as well as best forestry practices and legal ownership.




**Collateral Management**

Lumberscout will institute a collateral management system to limit loss in cases where collateral value drops below a certain threshold, the borrower must increase their collateral or the lender can call the collateral and sell it on the market. Alternatively, collateral swapping will be introduced where the lender can swap the collateral for a fee, to less volatile tokens, instead of selling.



**Increasing the Liquidity of the Forest Products Sector**

The FP industry is typically cash strapped to the point that there is no extra capital to make needed investments in machinery, automation or sustainability. Especially productions in developing nations that want to modernise and become responsible producers, access to funds and basic safety equipment are sorely lacking. Small loans can mean the difference between crushing poverty and lives filled with stewardship and meaningful work. By facilitating reputation-based lending with decentralised credit ratings, consisting of data on trade performance and data feeds from service providers such as credit institutions and social media, Lumberscout will provide investors with the information they need to make knowledgeable decisions. Moreover, services such as Bloom can be used to broadcast defaults to centralised credit scores.


**Competitive Bidding**

Lumberscout bidding functionality will be expanded from industrial commodities like logs, lumber and machinery to service providers: insurance, lending, freight forwarders and shipping. This will create competitive market conditions. For example, lenders can participate in interest rate bidding auctions; logistic companies can bid on freight routes and insurance companies can bid based on supplier risk profiles.




**Supply Chain Integration**

Lumberscout will be at the forefront of integrating blockchain based logistics into the Lumberscout platform. Earlier this year Maersk shipping (the world’s largest container shipping line), announced that it was cooperating with IBM to put all of its shipping on the blockchain within two years. Similar adoptions of blockchain technology will take place in domestic trucking operations. Lumberscout will aggregate these service providers and validation nodes. This will increase transparency and security for buyers, sellers and lenders.



**Increasing Sales Efficiency**

Lumberscout’s bidding, personal messaging system and social-media distributed inventory databases, funnel activity into formalised contracts with maximum efficiency. Bids can be made specifying quantities, grades, delivery and payment terms. At the end of the bidding process, both parties are sent copies of the contract and can download them from user account archives, where they are saved and timestamped. Each contract and their subsequent rating will form an irrevocable part of user reputation. These processes utilise technology to save time and reduce errors.




**Implementation of Block-Chain-of-Custody (BCoC) Sustainable Forestry Standards**

There are a variety of companies offering environmental certifications. The problem with these companies is that they have become for-profit bureaucracies that obliquely follow their mandate. Within the context of Lumberscout governance, holistic approaches to sustainability are possible. Once industry consensus is reached, such certifications can be put into practice and monitored in realtime. 






**Logistics Partnerships**

Lumberscout will develop auction-like bidding functionality to provide better freight rates. The lowest freight rate bid will win the auction and the programmed contract will accept that particular shipper as the funder of that programmed freight contract. Such bidding will provide the most competitive rate for the shippers since unlimited forwarders can participate on the bid. This can be applied to domestic trucking companies and scale up to include ocean shipping.





**Crypto Conditions**

Each CC contract has an eval code, this is just an arbitrary number that is associated with a specific CC contract. The details about a specific CC contract are all determined by the validation logic, that is ultimately what implements a CC contract. Unlike the normal bitcoin payments, where it is validated with only information in the transaction, a CC contract can be used execute a variety of business logic based transactions; ranging from the simple to the highly complex, eg. butterflies and straddles. The Lumberscout platform allows collateral to be applied to conditional, programmed contracts. If one of the parties does not perform their part according to the contract, funds can be returned. For example, a buyer applies pre-payment to a purchasing contract contingent on it shipping within two weeks. The seller has the surety that he will be paid, prompting him to act. The buyer’s risk of non-shipment is mitigated. If the conditions are not met he is refunded his deposit. The same principle can be applied between lenders and borrowers.


**Practical Use of Zero Knowledge (zk-SNARKs) & Platform Architecture**

Lumberscout will employ a series of blockchains to facilitate the trade of FPs. For the sake of simplicity they can be divided into the KYC regulated "trading chain" (TC) and the LUMBER "utility chain" (UC). The TC will use wrapped LUMBER, whereas the UC consists solely of unwrapped LUMBER. Transfers into and out of the TC will only be possible via zk-SNARKs. This will protect the TC and UC from chain analysis attack vectors or linkage by rogue actors as well as shield larger UC block buyers & sellers from predatory high-frequency trading (HFT) practices. This setup will allow Lumberscout to comply with KYC regulations on the TC while maintaining a zk-SNARKs "privacy hedge" between the TC & UC. For example: a KYC registered sawmill on the TC decides to borrow 100 LUMBER from a lender to build new dry kilns at a specified rate of interest. The lender would send a ztransaction to the TC with crypto-conditions specifying the recipient. The LUMBER is converted into wrapped LUMBER and credited to the sawmill's trading account on the TC. Likewise 100 LUMBER is deducted from the lender's balance of LUMBER on the UC. The sawmill promptly places an order with a dry kiln manufacturer for 100 LUMBER on the TC. The loan is reflected in both the sawmill's and lender's accounting departments. Business confidentiality and legality is maintained for both parties. This example presumes that the lender had 100 LUMBER to lend. If the lender only had 10 LUMBER at the conclusion of the loan agreement, the lender would have to purchase the remaining 90 LUMBER at market rates. Purchasing and selling LUMBER on the open market determines the price of LUMBER at any given time. Conversely, should a paper manufacturer wish to withdraw wrapped LUMBER in order to convert it into BTC, fiat, etc. wrapped LUMBER would be sent via crypto conditions and a ztransaction to their UC zaddress wallet. From there, funds can be held in perpetuity, moved or traded as desired.  





**VerusHash Algorithm**

The VerusHash algorithm -- the fastest CPU mining algorithm as of 2018 -- was developed by Michael J Toutonghi (ret. Microsoft VP) in the context of the Verus Coin project. Although it is possible to build ASIC miners for any algorithm if there is enough economic incentive, it is also possible to continuously adapt counter measures to ensure decentralised mining. VerusHash is a exceedingly CPU-friendly, quantum secure, long input  hash  function  that  uses  the  quantum  secure,  short  input  Haraka512  V2  as  its core compression algorithm.  It is fast, not due to the general purpose nature of the CPUs themselves, but from the AES-NI and AVX instruction sets, effectively an ASIC in the CPU. To augment the CPU-friendly proof of work algorithm with even more centralisation resistance, Lumberscout uses a proof of work (PoW) / proof of stake (PoS) hybrid algorithm for combined mining and staking that is immune to fluctuations in network hash rate.  This further hardens the chain against future ASICs and PoW only attacks that may be posed by  new ASIC  systems. This  approach  will incentivise the loyalty and dedication of the pre-ASIC mining community with staking rewards while securing the network. 



**Delayed Proof of Work (dPoW)**

Delayed proof of work is an extra security measure to eliminate the possibility of 51% attacks. The dPoW consensus method contains two different nodes: notary nodes and ‘normal nodes’. The Komodo security service is performed by notary nodes that record  transaction  data to the Bitcoin blockchain (notarization). With this method, even a single surviving copy of the KMD parent chain will make an overwrite possible should an attacker attempt to corrupt the ledger. 


**Bridging Ethereum**

Lumbescout's TALLY ERC20 token -- contract address: 0x9a614a75ee8afaee643109061563d6145bdd701c -- was launched on the Ethereum blockchain in Q1 of 2018. Lumberscout will continue to experiment, learn and work with the Ethereum community to facilitate atomic swaps between ERC20 and SHA256 protocols. The listing of TALLY on 0x, AirSwap and LedgerDEX are planned for Q1 2019.     

**DAO Governance**

Parallel to developing better inventory visibility, sales and supply chain infrastructure, Lumberscout will implement a DAO based delegate system for global governance and the continuous evolution of industry standards and practices, such as: forestry certification, grading standardisation, collateral management and codification of internal regulations. Proper DAO governance can solve problems before they become costly disputes that end up disrupting trade. The recent softwood trade dispute between USA and Canada is one recent example that can be expected to repeat itself unless better inter-trade regulations and decentralised consensus mechanisms are put into place. With DAO appointed regional delegates and transparent voting, the responsibilities of stewardship and consensus can be efficiently implemented. By building delegations, Lumberscout can have a significant impact on global sustainability and other environmental directives.




**Project Funding & Premine**

To fund development and early exchange activity, 6% of total supply or 1,260,600 LUMBER was premined. Some or all of this amount will be offered for sale to raise funds for the project. Early expenditures are necessary to build the trading chain, create intuitive user interfaces, marketing, verification training, legal codification of tokenised ownership, establishment of certification processes, DAO voting mechanisms, et al.
