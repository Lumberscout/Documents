**Summary of What We Are Developing**

Lumberscout will use decentralized technologies to change the forest products (FP) sector; providing a safe platform for industrial producers, industrial consumers and industrial lenders to conduct business. Lumberscout’s implementation of distributed ledgers, commodity certifications, supply chain verification and efficient sales architecture will fundamentally change how forest products are financed, traded and certified. By harnessing disruptive technologies and establishing verification and governance frameworks, Lumberscout makes trustless, meritocratic consensus mechanisms possible on a global scale. 



**Ethics & Standards**

Lumberscout is committed to ethical behavior and the advancement of industry by developing efficient, trustworthy trading infrastructure. Lumberscout is committed to the values of fairness, moral integrity, applicable law and fundamental human rights. Lumberscout will act to protect the privacy and wishes of our users, partners, and community. Lumberscout will engage in critical and regular assessments. Lumberscout will consistently and unwaveringly act in the best interests of our users, partners, investors, privacy, autonomy, equal access and environmental responsibility.




**Tokenization of Forest Products**

As the crypto-economy grows, so too does the demand for the tokenisation of commodities. The blockchain, much like containerised shipping, has redefined global trade. However, the practical aspects of verification at the beginning stages of the distributed ledger process requires close attention and new management as well as legal infrastructures. Lumberscout will implement verify and track procedures throughout the harvesting, production, transportation and manufacturing stages. By taking the first steps towards tokenising commodities, Lumberscout will connect the crypto economy with the Market of Things (MoT).




**Market Size**

Forest Products account for 5% of Gross World Product or 4 trillion USD in 2016. If you spent one USD per second, it would take you approximately 126,836 years to reach 4 trillion. According to U.N. statistics 33% of the world population currently depends on Forest Products for sustenance. Despite the importance of Forest Products to the global economy, novelties like “ride-sharing” services or “crypto-kitties” have distracted many to the fact that recent technological breakthroughs can entirely revolutionise established commodity-based industries. Lumberscout will redefine the Forest Products sector.




**Commodity Based**

By establishing LUMBER as a benchmark of utility within the context of Lumberscout's trading platform, its convertibility in the global market place will become more recognised as a standardised store of value for a new class of economic operators in a growing crypto economy. 




**Increasing the Liquidity of the Forest Products Sector**

The Forest Products industry is typically cash strapped to the point that there is no extra capital to make needed investments in machinery, automation or sustainability. Especially productions in developing nations that want to modernise and become responsible producers, access to funds and basic safety equipment are sorely lacking. Small loans can mean the difference between crushing poverty and lives filled with stewardship and meaningful work. By facilitating reputation-based lending with decentralised credit ratings, consisting of data on trade performance and data feeds from service providers such as credit institutions and social media, Lumberscout will provide investors with the information they need to make knowledgeable decisions. Moreover, services such as Bloom can be used to broadcast defaults to centralised credit scores.




**Empowering Crypto Lenders**

By providing secured assets with the use of ERC20 tokens as collateral to major crypto lenders like SALT, ETHlend, et al. — as well as private lenders — Lumberscout’s system of verification will be a pivotal actor in the tokenised collateral chain. Forest Products manufacturers that adopt Lumberscout’s verification program will gain access to heretofore impossible liquidity. For example, TALLY & LUMBER token holders can exchange them for commodity tokens on the platform, but are not required to do so. They can be held as collateral. Instead, the manufacturer can pledge his tokens to receive funds. In this way, commodity tokens can be used to secure loans and can be sold off if required. In addition to Lumberscout’s own credit rating system, Lumberscout will, on behalf of the user — if so desired — allow their scores to be broadcast to other decentralised credit rating institutions. Additionally, oracles can be used to provide feeds from social media for creating a more complete credit profile. In this way Lumberscout will act as a third-party repository of unalterable data that will serve lenders, financial markets and trade partners in perpetuity. Adoption of Lumberscout’s rating system will become more valuable to sellers, buyers and lenders over time as its data grows and its predictive algorithms are refined.




**Environmental and Value Certification Processes**

To insure Lumberscout's environmental commitment as well as value assessment  certification, auditing procedures will be implemented on multiple fronts. Self-audits will begin the process with special attention given to grading accuracy, commodity volumes as well as best forestry practices and legal ownership.




**Collateral Management (risk mitigation)**

Lumberscout will institute a collateral management system to limit loss in cases where collateral value drops below a certain threshold, the borrower must increase their collateral or the lender can call the collateral and sell it on the market. Alternatively, collateral swapping will be introduced where the lender can swap the collateral for a fee, to less volatile tokens, instead of selling.





**Competitive Bidding**

Lumberscout bidding functionality will be expanded from industrial commodities like logs, lumber and machinery to service providers: insurance, lending, freight forwarders and shipping. This will create competitive market conditions. For example, lenders can participate in interest rate bidding auctions; logistic companies can bid on freight routes and insurance companies can bid based on supplier risk profiles.




**Supply Chain Integration**

Lumberscout will be at the forefront of integrating blockchain based logistics into the Lumberscout platform. Earlier this year Maersk shipping (the world’s largest container shipping line), announced that it was cooperating with IBM to put all of its shipping on the blockchain within two years. Similar adoptions of blockchain technology will take place in domestic trucking operations. Lumberscout will be the app that aggregates these service providers and validation nodes into one application. This will increase transparency and security for buyers, sellers and lenders.



**Increasing Sales Efficiency**

Lumberscout’s bidding, personal messaging system and social-media distributed inventory databases, funnel activity into formalised contracts with maximum efficiency. Bids can be made specifying quantities, grades, delivery and payment terms. At the end of the bidding process, both parties are sent copies of the contract and can download them from user account archives, where they are saved and timestamped. Each contract and their subsequent rating will form an irrevocable part of user reputation. These processes utilise technology to save time and reduce errors.




**Implementation of Block-Chain-of-Custody (BCoC) Sustainable Forestry Standards**

There are a variety of companies offering forest certifications. The problem with these companies is that they have become for-profit bureaucracies that obliquely follow their mandate. Within the context of the Lumberscout DAO, holistic approaches to sustainability are possible. Once industry consensus is reached, such certifications can be put into practice.






**Logistics Partnerships**

Lumberscout will develop auction-like bidding functionality to provide better freight rates. The lowest freight rate bid will win the auction and the programmed contract will accept that particular shipper as the funder of that programmed freight contract. Such bidding will provide the most competitive rate for the shippers since unlimited forwarders can participate on the bid. This can be applied to domestic trucking companies and scale up to include ocean shipping.






**Trading Architecture & Practical Use of zk-SNARKs**

Lumberscout will employ a series of blockchains to facilitate the trade forest products. For the sake of simplicity they could be simplified into the proprietary "trading chain" (TC) and the LUMBER "utility chain" (UC). The TC will use crypto-conditioned, wrapped LUMBER, whereas the UC will consist exclusively of unwrapped LUMBER. Transfers into and out of the TC will require zk-SNARKs. This will ensure that there is no chain analysis attack vector linkage between the TC and the UC; while protecting institutional buyers from predatory high-frequency trading (HFT) practices. 




**Delayed Proof of Work (dPoW)**

The dPoW consensus method contains two different nodes: notary nodes and ‘normal nodes’. The Komodo security service is performed by notary nodes  which  are  needed  to  record  transaction  data  to  the  Bitcoin blockchain, referred to as notarization. With this method, even a single surviving copy of the Komodo main chain will allow the entire ecosystem to overwrite and overrule any of an attacker’s attempted changes. 



**Crypto Conditions**

Each CC contract has an eval code, this is just an arbitrary number that is associated with a specific CC contract. The details about a specific CC contract are all determined by the validation logic, that is ultimately what implements a CC contract. Unlike the normal bitcoin payments, where it is validated with only information in the transaction, a CC contract can be used execute a variety of business logic based transactions; ranging from the simple to the highly complex, eg. butterflies and straddles. The Lumberscout platform allows collateral to be applied to conditional programmed contracts. If one of the parties does not perform their part according to the contract, funds can be returned. For example, a buyer applies pre-payment to a purchasing contract contingent on it shipping within two weeks. The seller has the surety that he will be paid, prompting him to act. The buyer’s risk of non-shipment is mitigated. If the conditions are not met he is refunded his deposit. The same principle can be applied between lenders and borrowers.




**VerusHash Algo**

The VerusHash algorithm, bringing near-equality between CPUs and GPUs with the fastest CPU mining algorithm in the world. The VerusPoS algorithm, allowing for a 60/40 hybrid blockchain with a 60% PoS / 40% Equihash for the proof of work component; giving LUMBER hodlers, early-adopters and small miners equal footing with larger ASIC miners -- at least in the timeframe that ASICs are not developed for the VerusHash. 




**DAO Governance**

Parallel to developing better inventory visibility, sales and supply chain infrastructure, Lumberscout will implement a DAO based delegate system for global governance and the continuous evolution of industry standards and practices, such as: forestry certification, grading standardisation, collateral management and codification of international regulations. Proper DAO governance can solve problems before they devolve into costly disputes that end up in prolonged, centralised arbitration. The recent softwood trade dispute between USA and Canada is one recent example that can be expected to repeat itself unless better inter-trade regulations and decentralised consensus mechanisms are put into place. With DAO appointed regional delegates and transparent voting mechanisms the responsibilities of stewardship and consensus can be efficiently implemented. By building delegations, Lumberscout can have a significant impact on global sustainability and other environmental directives.




**Project Funding & Premine**

To fund development and early exchange activity, 6% of total supply or 1,260,600 LUMBER was premined. Some or all of this amount will be offered for sale to raise funds needed for further project development. The main areas of expenditure in the beginning will be development of the trading chain, intuitive user interfaces, marketing, training, as well as legal expenditures to codify ownership of tokenised FPs and certification processes followed by DAO voting infrastructure and community participation initiatives.
